# GameboySQ - 42's BSQ running on Gameboy.

GameboySQ is a replica of the BSQ (Biggest square) project. It's the hardest team project during the Piscine. I failed at it back then and didn't want to give up there, so i made it run on limited hardware.

## GBDK & Resources

I would recommend trying out making projects on Gameboy to start homebrews. It works surprisingly well, has plenty of tools available and remains very simple if you can write some C.

[GBDK](https://gbdk-2020.github.io/gbdk-2020/docs/api/docs_supported_consoles.html) is an amazing library which lets you make games or programs on a few game systems such as NES and GB. You can write programs with a mix of C and Assembly. It's a perfect entry point for people who want to try out making homebrews.

[PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/) is a documentation filled with Gameboy technical information.
